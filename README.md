## Overview  
**FitUp** is a mobile fitness app designed to help users track workouts, monitor progress, and achieve fitness goals through personalized training plans. The app includes a freemium model with paid monthly or yearly subscriptions for premium access.

This project complements the earlier [FitUp Data Analysis project](https://github.com/Andrii-Klipailo/FitUp_Data_Analysis), shifting the focus from product performance to **user profiling**. Here, we aim to understand who our users are and how their background and goals impact app usage.

## Objective  
The goal of this analysis is to build a **comprehensive user portrait** by exploring demographics, activity levels, goals, and other key attributes using Tableau visualizations based on the FitUp dataset.

## Key Insights from the Dashboard  

### Age Distribution  
![age](https://github.com/Andrii-Klipailo/FitUp_User_Portrait_Dashboard/blob/main/images/age.png) 
**25%** of all users fall within the **20â€“25** age group.  
This suggests a young and tech-savvy audience â€” ideal for mobile app engagement.

### Gender Breakdown  
![gender](https://github.com/Andrii-Klipailo/FitUp_User_Portrait_Dashboard/blob/main/images/gender.png) 
The user base is predominantly **male (65%)**.  
This skew may be worth addressing through targeted content or marketing for underrepresented groups.

### Activity Levels & Goals
![activity](https://github.com/Andrii-Klipailo/FitUp_User_Portrait_Dashboard/blob/main/images/activity.png) 
**50%** of users identify as **beginners**.  
Among them, **40% aim to lose weight**, yet half of them only show **medium activity levels**.  
This indicates a gap between intent and engagement â€” and a potential area for nudging users into more consistent habits.

### Geographic Distribution  
![map](https://github.com/Andrii-Klipailo/FitUp_User_Portrait_Dashboard/blob/main/images/map.png) 
FitUp is most popular in **France and Germany**, which together represent the largest share of users.  

Additional findings:  
- 4 out of 10 users have a **gym membership**, indicating a strong investment mindset toward fitness.  
- The profile insights are especially representative of users from these two countries.


## Findings and Conclusion  

This dashboard provides a clear snapshot of the FitUp user base:  
- The typical user is a **young male beginner** aged **20â€“25**, located in **France or Germany**.  
- Many users have **clear fitness goals** (like weight loss), but their **activity levels suggest a need for stronger engagement loops**.  
- The **high rate of gym membership** suggests financial and motivational readiness â€” an opportunity for upselling and deeper integration of in-app + offline routines.
